        <p class="lead mb-4">As a business marketing major, I aspire to expand my experience in customer sales, marketing and customer service. I personally want to grow in all knowledge of fields whether it be marketing, administrative, sales, managing or analytical. Upon being a business major, the world of business is very diverse. Business could undergo through any form of career whether to sell a product, advertise, or abstract new ideas. What really sold me in pursuing being a business major is the idea of collaborating with different teams, demonstrating personal and team ideas, advertising, and social media platforms. With being only 19 years old, I still have a lot of things to learn, which inputs that I am willing to get all the experience I could grasp. 

 <br><br>

        Upon my personal experience, I have seen the differences between customer and client behaviors. Some customers/clients are more responsive and upfront than others. Majority of the customers and clients I work with are understanding and patient. However, there are the few 10% of customers and clients I have that are aggressive and really impatient. Between the two different customer behaviors, both lead to different business effects. Those who are more patient are likely to receive what they ask for and those who are impatient are more harder to work with thus leaving them not leaving with exactly what they asked for. 
<br><br>

        To be a successful business marketer, you must always have a plan with a back-up that follows along with it. Your business ideas and plans is what sells your company towards lenders, partners, investors and key associates/employees. In addition, the marketing plan demonstrates how to sell your products. Beneath the strategy of business marketing, you may also need to form a loyal team of employees. The outspoken word of loyalty is very important in this case because without loyalty and trust within your partners a lot of business will not be able to be conducted properly, which may harm the business instead of benefit it. Most importantly, it is essential that your business plans include a clear formative outline of the marketing plan, which will lead you in the right direction of achieving your sales goals. When creating a marketing plan it must include certain components to be successful. One great component to remember is your marketing objectives and goals: you and your team need to discuss what does the company specifically need to do and what steps to take to make sure everything works out successfully. Another important component to note is analyzing all different marketing situations that also include multiple scenarios among the customer, business climate, and most importantly competitors. In addition, other components may include, your businessâ€™ long range plans as well as the companyâ€™s action plans and also the businessâ€™ marketing budget. Marketing strategies are also key when forming a successful marketing business plan. Your marketing strategies should include pricing, promotion, your products and services. Social media marketing also plays an important role in the business marketing field. Networking/ advertising can increase your audience and allows you to bring in more customers. It is likely that more people will buy your product if it is advertised correctly.
